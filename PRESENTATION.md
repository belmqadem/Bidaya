# Bidaya — Pitch Presentation (3 min)

> 8 slides. ~20–25 seconds per slide. Optimized for the 4 judging criteria.

---

## SLIDE 1 — Title (5s)

**Visual:** Clean, bold. Baby/health icon or stethoscope. Soft gradient background.

```
Bidaya
بداية

The verified digital child health record —
connecting parents, clinics & pharmacies.
```

---

## SLIDE 2 — The Problem (25s)

**Visual:** Split layout. Left: photo of a worn paper carnet. Right: bullet points.

**Speaker notes:** Open with a fact. "700,000 children are born in Morocco every year. Each one gets a paper health booklet. Here's what happens next..."

```
The Problem

• Paper health booklets get lost, damaged, or left at home
• Parents have zero remote access to their child's medical history
• After vaccination side effects → parents must physically go to the clinic
• Paper prescriptions are easily forged and reused
• No communication channel between parent, doctor, and pharmacy

→ Fragmented care. No traceability. No trust.
```

**Criteria hit:** Clinical Relevance — real, widespread problem in pediatric care.

## SLIDE 3 — The Solution (25s)

**Visual:** 3 connected cards: Parent / Clinic / Pharmacy with arrows between them.

**Speaker notes:** "Bidaya digitizes the child health record and creates a secure communication loop between the 3 actors."

```
Our Solution

A clinic-verified digital health record with a secure
communication circuit between 3 actors:

PARENT                  CLINIC                    PHARMACY
• View full health      • Create verified         • Look up prescriptions
  record & vaccine        child records             by unique code
  calendar              • Manage vaccinations     • Verify details &
• Report side effects     & consultations           dispense
  (voice + photo)       • Respond to reports      • Lock prescription
• Receive digital       • Issue digital             after use (no reuse)
  prescriptions           prescriptions (ORD-XXXX)

Every record = a unique ID generated by the clinic.
```

**Criteria hit:** Clinical Relevance + Entrepreneurship — clear 3-sided value.

---

## SLIDE 4 — Product Demo (45s)

**Visual:** Embedded demo video OR annotated screenshots of the key flow.

**Speaker notes:** This is the most important slide. Show, don't tell. Walk through fast.

```
Live Demo — Full Flow in 45 seconds

1. CLINIC → Register a newborn → Unique ID generated
2. PARENT → Log in with ID + phone + OTP
   → See profile, vaccine calendar, medical timeline
3. PARENT → Report a side effect
   → Dictate symptoms using VOICE (ElevenLabs Speech-to-Text)
   → Attach a PHOTO of the symptoms
4. CLINIC → Receive report + photo → Reply to parent
   → Issue a digital prescription (ORD-XXXX-XXXX)
5. PHARMACY → Enter code → Verify → Dispense → LOCKED

+ BONUS: AI Neonatal Risk Prediction (MiniMax)
  → Input maternal data → Predicted birth weight + risk level
```

**Tip:** Pre-record a 45s screen capture as backup. Live demo is impressive but risky.

## SLIDE 5 — Sponsor Tools Integration (25s)

**Visual:** 3 large tool logos side by side, each with what we used it for.

**Speaker notes:** "We deeply integrated all three sponsor tools — not as add-ons, but as core features."

```

│    medical fields: reason, diagnosis, treatment)    │
│  • Server-side with JSON validation & fallback      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Criteria hit:** Sponsor Tools Integration — all 3 tools used as core features.

# Q&A PREP (2 min)

Likely questions and short answers to prepare:

**"How do you ensure data security?"**
→ Server-side API keys, cookie-based sessions with role guards,
  rate limiting, OTP for parents, prescriptions locked after dispensing.

**"What about scalability?"**
→ PostgreSQL on Neon (serverless), Next.js on Vercel (edge-ready),
  Prisma ORM for clean DB access. Ready to scale.

**"How is this different from existing solutions?"**
→ Existing solutions are either parent-facing OR clinic-facing.
  Bidaya connects all 3 actors (parent + clinic + pharmacy)
  in one verified circuit with anti-fraud prescriptions.

**"What's next / business model?"**
→ Partner with Moroccan Ministry of Health for pilot clinics.
  Freemium: free for parents, subscription for clinics/pharmacies.
  Revenue from prescription verification API.

**"How accurate is the AI risk prediction?"**
→ Trained on real neonatal data. Gives 3 risk levels with
  predicted birth weight. Designed as a decision-support tool,
  not a replacement for clinical judgment.

# SPEAKING TIPS

1. **Open with a number:** "700,000 children are born in Morocco every year.
   Their health record? A piece of paper."
2. **Demo is king.** Spend the most time here. Judges want to see it work.
3. **Name the sponsor tools explicitly.** Say "built with Cursor", "powered by
   ElevenLabs", "using MiniMax" — make it obvious.
4. **End with emotion.** "Because every child deserves verified healthcare
   from day one."
5. **Rehearse 3x minimum.** Time yourself. Cut anything over 3:00.
6. **Don't read slides.** Slides are visual anchors. You tell the story.
